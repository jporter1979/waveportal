# Wave Portal
This is a simple web3 project that allows a user to connect their wallet and send a message (wave) which will be stored on the blockchain. The frontend captures all new wave events (emmitted by transactions) on the blockchain and displays them on the webpage in realtime.

# Tools
The tools used to develop the application are:
- Backend: Solidity/Hardhart
- Frontend: React.js

# Access
The app can be accessed at the following url: https://waveportal-starter-project.jporter1979.repl.co/. Users will need to connect their wallet to the Rinkeby testnet.
